Here's how the updated script works:

setlocal enabledelayedexpansion enables delayed environment variable expansion, which allows the script to evaluate variables inside a loop.

set PREFIX=_ sets the PREFIX variable to _.

for /f "tokens=2 delims=: " %%s in ('sc query state^= all ^| findstr /b /c:"SERVICE_NAME: %PREFIX%"') do loops through all services whose name starts with the PREFIX variable.

set SERVICE_NAME=%%s sets the SERVICE_NAME variable to the name of the current service.

sc query !SERVICE_NAME! | find "RUNNING" queries the service to see if it is running.

if !errorlevel! == 0 checks if the previous command was successful. If it was, that means the service is running.

net stop !SERVICE_NAME! stops the service.

net start !SERVICE_NAME! starts the service.

If the service is not running, the script skips steps 7 and 8 and goes directly to step 10.

net start !SERVICE_NAME! starts the service.

The loop repeats for each service name that starts with the PREFIX variable.

pause adds a pause to the end of the script to keep the window open and show the output.

Note that the ^ symbol before the = sign in state^= all is used to escape the = sign, which is a special character in batch scripts. The findstr /b /c:"SERVICE_NAME: %PREFIX%" command is used to filter the list of services to only include those whose name starts with the PREFIX variable.
